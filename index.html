<div class="about">
  <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Devon.</p>
  <p>I am a curious, young journalist exploring interests in data, editing and social media.</p>
  <p>I'm currently the editor in chief of The Diamondback, the University of
    Maryland's independent student newspaper. Here, I work with other editors to manage daily content production and keep the newsroom running smoothly. I have helped create and modify policies, such a refining our news reporting and editing guide to ensure accuracy in our stories and updating our stylebook to incorporate more inclusive language, to make The Diamondback a more equitable newsroom. I'm the first woman of color editor in chief of The Diamondback in the past five years.</p>
  <p>I am also a data reporter for the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism. There, I am collaborating on a major Associated Press investigation into law enforcement practices. I work with other reporters to identify patterns and use R to test hypotheses.</p>
  <p>When I'm not writing or coding, you can find me bingeing movies I've already seen or improving my cooking skills with TikTok recipes.</p>
